# IPL-Prediction
The aim of this project is to build a system that predicts the outcome of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches based on historical data and current inputs such as team lineups, toss decisions, and match venues. The model uses machine learning to forecast the winning team with a certain level of accuracy.
